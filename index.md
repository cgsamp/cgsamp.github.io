title: Welcome to my blog

I am a dad, engineer and cloud-native developer.

Of late, I have been employed with Pivotal, VMware and now Broadcom. My role is Solutions Architect, aka Field Sales Engineer, focused on the Tanzu platform. 

I have a 25-year (!!) history with Java, and most of my career was as a developer or dev manager, primarily with Java and Spring, but also Python, NodeJS, PHP, Go and some front end stuff like CSS, JQuery and React. 

In the 2010s I spent time as CTO / VP of Engineering for a couple startups, and learned a lot about container-based development and orchestration, including AWS, GCP, Azure and vSphere / VCF. My lens into this stack is from "above" as a software engineer trying to get quality code into production and finish in time to make it to my kids' band concerts and the like.
